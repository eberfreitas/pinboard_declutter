# Pinboard Declutter

Highly optionated script to update and remove bookmarks from [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/).

Right now it...

- Checks for different title and description and updates the entry with new data;
- Checks if the URL is a 404 and deletes it;
- Checks if the URL is unavailable and deletes it;
- Follows redirects and replaces the old entry with the new one (only 301 and 302 http statuses).

## Compiling

You will need Elixir(1.9)/Erlang to compile. Download the code and run:

```
